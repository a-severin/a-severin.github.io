Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</h2><p>Visual Studio Online Services which is now are known as Azure DevOps turns the table for me. I’ve used it since its inception in 2013.</p>
<p>In 2012 we used bitbucket for repo, redbooth for tickets, and dropbox as artifacts delivering. </p>
<p>“It’s working on my computer!” - for sure.</p>
<p>“It’s building on my laptop!” - for sure.</p>
<p>“Which task this does commit mean?” - for sure.</p>
<p>It was a long way. Now it’s looking obviously.<br>You have a user-story driven backlog, all brunches and commits are associated with tasks and issues.<br>Each piece of work is moved throw PR, CI, tests, and then merged in the main branch.</p>
<p>Even so, I still have problems with delivery to customers. I do a desktop application and customer’s networks closed.<br>But I do not give up. Just need to study some PowerShell stuff and automation tools.</p>
